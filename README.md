# Anomaly-Detection-Models
Anomaly Detection deep-learning models Transformer-based.

Written in Python using PyTorch and Numpy.

Inspired by:
- [AnomalyBERT](https://github.com/Jhryu30/AnomalyBERT/tree/main);
- [Graph Attention Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903);
- [FNet: Mixing Tokens with Fourier Transforms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.03824.pdf).

Works in progress...
